# Environmental-Impact-Tracker

Introduction - 
The Environmental Impact Tracker is a comprehensive analytical system designed to monitor, assess, and optimize sustainability metrics, ensuring efficient resource utilization and minimizing environmental impact.
Efficient energy consumption is a key factor in building a sustainable future. This project focuses on analyzing electricity and fuel usage across environmental activities to identify high-energy-consuming processes and promote better energy efficiency strategies.
By utilizing structured data from sustainability initiatives, this study offers valuable insights into energy consumption patterns and suggests optimizations for reducing environmental impact.

Objectives - 
✔ Assess average energy consumption per activity using SQL queries.
✔ Rank activities based on electricity usage to optimize energy efficiency.
✔ Compare fuel-based vs renewable energy consumption trends.
✔ Provide insights for organizations to enhance sustainability strategies.

ER Diagram -
The Environmental Impact Tracker is structured using an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram that defines the relationships between projects, activities, carbon footprint, energy usage, and waste management.

Entity Relationships - 
- Each Project may have multiple Activities.
- Activities are linked to Carbon Footprint, Energy Usage, and Waste Management to track their environmental impact.
- Foreign keys in Carbon Footprint, Energy Usage, and Waste Management ensure data consistency and integration.
- The ER diagram in MySQL Workbench visually represents these relationships, assisting in query optimization and data integrity.

Future Improvements & Recommendations - 
🚀 Optimize high-energy activities using sustainable technology.
🚀 Reduce reliance on fossil fuels by shifting to renewable energy sources.
🚀 Develop automated monitoring systems to track real-time energy consumption.
🚀 Expand investment in clean energy solutions to minimize environmental impact
