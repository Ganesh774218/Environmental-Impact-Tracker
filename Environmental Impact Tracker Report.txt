Introduction - 
The Environmental Impact Tracker project is a comprehensive data-driven initiative designed to monitor, analyze, and enhance the sustainability performance of diverse environmental projects. By centralizing information on energy usage, waste management, and carbon footprint, this system empowers organizations to make informed decisions that maximize positive ecological outcomes.

This project systematically collects and integrates data from multiple sustainability activities, enabling unified analysis and benchmarking across projects and organizations. Through advanced analytics and structured reporting, it identifies trends, highlights high-impact areas, and supports the development of targeted strategies for resource efficiency and emissions reduction.

The Environmental Impact Tracker not only facilitates real-time monitoring of key environmental metrics but also provides actionable insights for continuous improvement and long-term sustainability planning. By leveraging this platform, stakeholders can drive impactful change, demonstrate accountability, and contribute meaningfully to global environmental goals.

Problem Statement - 
As global energy consumption continues to rise, environmental projects must prioritize efficiency to minimize waste and achieve a sustainable impact. Understanding which activities consume the most resources can help redirect efforts toward renewable energy solutions and better conservation strategies.
This project offers valuable insights into energy-intensive activities, enabling researchers and policymakers to make informed decisions.

Objectives -
1)Centralize Environmental Data:
- Aggregate information from multiple sustainability projects for unified analysis.

2)Track Key Environmental Metrics:
- Monitor energy consumption, waste generation, and carbon emissions at both project and activity levels.

3)Enable Data-Driven Decisions:
- Provide actionable insights to improve resource efficiency and reduce environmental impact.

Database Schema
Tables Used:
- projects → Stores details of environmental projects metadata (name, description, dates, organization).
- activities → Tracks sustainability actions within each project including impact type and dates.
- carbon_footprint → Logs CO₂ emissions or reductions per activity.
- energy_usage → Stores data on electricity (kWh) & fuel (liters) consumed per activity.
- waste_management → Monitors recycling & landfill waste metrics by activities.


Relationships -
-Each activity is linked to a project via project_id.
-Energy usage, waste, and carbon data are tied to activities and projects by foreign keys.

Analytical Approach -
Key Metrics and Queries -
1) Project Count: Total projects tracked for organizational scale.

2) Project Timelines: Identify oldest, newest, and longest-duration projects.

3) Energy & Fuel Analysis: Aggregate electricity and fuel consumption by activity and project.

4) Waste Analysis: Compare recycled vs. landfill waste per project and activity.

5) Carbon Emissions: Summarize emissions and identify activities/projects achieving net reductions.

6) Activity Impact: Rank activities by environmental impact type and frequency.

Analysis and metrics findings -
-Based on the query results, the following key insights were obtained:
| Activity Name            | Avg Electricity (kWh) | Avg Fuel (Liters) | 
| Hydrogen Fuel Research   | 620.5 kWh             | 30.8 L            | 
| Smart Grid Trials        | 540.2 kWh             | 25.1 L            | 
| Solar Panel Installation | 450.0 kWh             | 15.7 L            | 
| EV Charging Setup        | 310.8 kWh             | 18.2 L            | 
| Tree Planting Drive      | 90.5 kWh              | 0 L               |

Key Findings:
- Hydrogen Fuel Research and Smart Grid Trials are the most energy-intensive activities.
- Renewable energy activities (Solar Panel Installation, EV Charging Setup) show moderate electricity consumption.
- Tree planting activities consume minimal electricity and zero fuel, contributing positively to sustainability.
- Activities like "Wind turbine deployment" and "Installing solar panels" have high average energy use, indicating focus areas for  
  efficiency improvements.
- Projects with higher recycled than landfill waste demonstrate successful waste diversion strategies.

ER Diagram -
Overview -
This ER diagram represents the data structure for an Environmental Impact Tracker system, designed to monitor and analyze the environmental performance of projects through energy usage, waste management, and carbon footprint tracking.

The ER diagram consists of five core entities:
- Projects: Stores details about environmental projects, including names, descriptions, and timelines.
- Activities: Tracks sustainability-related actions within each project, specifying their environmental impact.
- Carbon Footprint: Records emissions data for activities, helping analyze the overall CO₂ impact.
- Energy Usage: Logs electricity and fuel consumption per activity, facilitating energy optimization.
- Waste Management: Monitors recycled and landfill waste data for each project, supporting waste reduction efforts.
Entity Relationships -
- Each Project may have multiple Activities.
- Activities are linked to Carbon Footprint, Energy Usage, and Waste Management to track their environmental impact.
- Foreign keys in Carbon Footprint, Energy Usage, and Waste Management ensure data consistency and integration.
- The ER diagram in MySQL Workbench visually represents these relationships, assisting in query optimization and data integrity.

Significance -
- This ER diagram provides a robust foundation for centralized environmental data management, enabling organizations to monitor, 
  analyze, and improve their sustainability performance through integrated tracking of energy, waste, and carbon metrics
- It provides a structured approach to environmental data analysis, helping organizations and policymakers:
✔ Monitors sustainability progress across projects.
✔ Optimize energy consumption and reduce carbon emissions.
✔ Improve waste management strategies through real-time tracking.
✔ Support data-driven decision-making for environmental sustainability.
